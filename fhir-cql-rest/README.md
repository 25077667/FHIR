#fhir-cql-rest

This module provides an implementation of data and terminology providers for the open source CQL engine using an IBM-FHIR REST client. This backend can be used by clients that want to run outside of the IBM FHIR server, but without the HAPI-FHIR dependencies that come with the open source CQL Engine's FHIR backend.
